# InfinityCube
The files for the Arduino Nano code are in the Infinity_Cube folder.<br>
The Gerber files for the custom LED Strips are in the LedLightStrip.zip file. It is not necessary to unzip the file to use it, just upload the zip file as it is.<br>

Please let me know of any issues with these files.<br>
